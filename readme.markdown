# League Mono
=============
_by [Tyler Finck](http://www.tylerfinck.com)_

**Eight weights of monospace fun. Or variable font fun, whatever.** 

League Mono is a mashup of sorts, inspired by some beautiful forms found in both Fira Mono, Libertinus Mono, and Courier(?!). 

League Mono was created for The League of Moveable Type using Glyphs app, with masters for the Thin, Regular, and Bold weights, and interpolated instances for the UltraLight, Light, Medium, SemiBold, and ExtraBold weights. 

May 25 2018 update: League Mono has been made a variable font:

Use the one TTF file called “LeagueMonoVariable.ttf” for 24 predefined styles of League Mono. Then tweak the weight or width (from condensed – 50 – to extended – 200 - with various weights – 30 through 200).
